# Clojure-Pig

A practice game using play-clj

Move the pig using left and right keypad arrows.  
Get a point for each ear of corn you reach/eat.  
Axe drops randomly & ends game if it hits pig.  
Use up/down arrows to adjust speed between 10 and 50.  
There is a hidden lion. The faster you go, the more likely he is to pounce.  
The pig grows as he eats, and his increased size makes the lion less likely to pounce, though he is a bigger target for the axe.

Esc key restarts game.  

Tested with Mac and Windows.
